## Grant Application for a Technological Startup

**Grant Program:** Bpifrance Innovation

**Startup Name:** AgroTech Innovation

**Location:** Paris, Île-de-France

**Sector:** Sustainable Agriculture

**Executive Summary:**

AgroTech Innovation is a startup specializing in the development of technological solutions for sustainable agriculture. Our main product is a drone equipped with intelligent sensors that helps farmers monitor their crops in real-time and optimize water and nutrient use. We are requesting a grant of €100,000 from Bpifrance to finalize the development of the prototype and launch pilot tests in three agricultural regions in France.

**Problem:**

Modern agriculture faces challenges such as water scarcity, soil degradation, and inefficient fertilization practices. Farmers often lack accurate data to optimize their processes and reduce their environmental impact.

**Proposed Solution:**

Our intelligent drone enables real-time crop monitoring through advanced sensors that measure soil moisture, nutrient levels, and signs of plant stress. This data is then analyzed by our artificial intelligence software, which provides personalized recommendations to farmers for optimal resource management.

**Funding Request and Use of Funds:**

We are requesting a grant of €100,000, which will be allocated as follows:

* Drone prototype development: €50,000
* Pilot tests on farms: €30,000
* Recruitment of engineers and agricultural experts: €15,000
* Product marketing and promotion: €5,000

**Timeline and Milestones:**

* Q1: Finalization of the prototype
* Q2: Pilot tests in three agricultural regions
* Q3: Analysis of results and technology adjustments
* Q4: National commercial launch

**Impact:**

Thanks to our solution, farmers will be able to save water, reduce the use of chemicals, and increase their yields sustainably. This will contribute to the preservation of natural resources and the protection of the environment while improving the profitability of farms in France.
